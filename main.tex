\chapter*{Abstract}

A growing number of companies are turning to open innovation to stay competitive. Open innovation is  \textquote{a distributed innovation process involving the purposive management of knowledge flows across organisational boundaries using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the firm's business model} \citep{chesbrough2014explicating}. The innovation process relies heavily on accessing, absorbing, and harnessing knowledge across organisational boundaries with open innovation. Tacit knowledge refers to an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities through experience that is difficult to put into words or otherwise communicate. It is strongly implicated in innovation as it guides the learning and thought processes that produce novel ideas. Despite the importance of tacit knowledge for innovation, it has received scant attention in the open innovation literature. \medskip

Open innovation implies extensive inter-organisational relationships to gain access to new external knowledge and exploit novel ideas, implying that a network perspective is needed to understand open innovation processes fully. This thesis treats an open innovation partnership as a temporary knowledge network deliberately set up to achieve a specific innovation outcome. \medskip

Open innovation entails helping others develop the ability to apply knowing and knowledge in new and different contexts. Sharing know-how is primarily an act of volition or free will. Hence, this thesis argues that human agency lies at the heart of tacit knowledge exchange. The actions of individual participants from each partner organisation ultimately determine the functional structure of an open innovation partnership (the largely informal structures where things get done). Finding the right balance between structure and agency is a challenge in open innovation. Too much structure may inhibit individual willingness to share tacit knowledge or contribute ideas. Conversely, too little structure can make goals less clear, leading to unsatisfactory open innovation outcomes. The academic literature suggests that human agents are primarily motivated to acquire tacit knowledge to satisfy an innate need for competence and gain sufficient power to maintain or enhance their autonomy, influence agendas, and enact change. External factors that affect tacit knowledge exchanges include subjective and behavioural norms, real or perceived boundaries, rules of engagement, and trust and power relations. The literature also suggests brokers have a crucial role in helping individuals overcome boundaries, build trust, and manage power relations. ≈\medskip

This thesis used a combination of statistical models for social networks (exponential random graph models) and semi-structured interviews to investigate the emergence of tacit knowledge network structures in three open innovation case studies. It employed critical realism to interpret the quantitative and qualitative results. The stratified ontology of critical realism allows for the legitimate combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. One set of ERGMs examined the role of motivation, trust, and power in tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Another set of ERGMs looked at broker roles in both tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Results from the first set of ERGMs underscored the importance of tacit knowledge in open innovation. Path closure in a social network reflects a human tendency to form groups. Two of the partnerships had a significant path closure in their tacit knowledge networks. No such effect is evident in the explicit knowledge networks. In other words, tacit knowledge sharing or exchange features strongly in group work. A significant receiver effect for autonomous motivation in each partnership's tacit knowledge network indicates that autonomous motivation is a reliable predictor of learning intent or knowledge-seeking behaviour. The second model runs indicate that path closure and broker roles can account for virtually all observed network configurations, highlighting the significance of brokerage in knowledge transfer processes. This result indicates that one can characterise open innovation partnerships in terms of broker roles alone. The broker roles provide valuable insight into knowledge exchange mechanisms and what this may mean in terms of absorptive and desorptive capacity. \medskip

Analysis of semi-structured interviews indicates that tacit knowledge is often under-appreciated, which can negatively impact problem-solving and innovation. Moreover, the qualitative analysis indicates that brokers can profoundly affect the application of knowledge in practice. Tension was evident in those partnerships dominated by one individual. Trust features strongly in most decisions to share tacit knowledge. Perceived acts of self-interest erode trust and contribute to partner tension. Generally, people are less likely to disclose their hard-earned tacit knowledge in low-trust situations. Tacit knowledge resided in various internal and external communities of practice, and brokers were crucial for connecting these different communities. The qualitative analysis also confirmed that individuals were primarily motivated to seek out tacit knowledge to improve their level of self-determination. However, this thesis also found that close-minded individuals or individuals who consider themselves superior are less likely to connect with external communities of practice. The ability to tap external communities of practice is affected by several mechanisms, including actual or perceived boundaries and power and trust relations. \medskip

This thesis also revealed that individuals are more likely to share their tacit knowledge if it delivers personal benefit. It found that successful open innovation requires partners to invest in relationships to facilitate open and honest discussions vital for practical problem solving and innovation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}
\chapter*{Foreword}

One must demonstrate a capacity for independent, critical thinking in a doctoral thesis. Examiners want to see evidence of originality and logical arguments. They do not want to see careless mistakes that indicate sloppy research \citep{mullins2002its}. My goal in writing this thesis was to present a rigorous and coherent analysis of tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. It was clear early on that I would need a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to address my research questions. Reconciling different ontological and epistemological assumptions can be quite problematic in mixed-method research, which led me to embrace critical realism as my research philosophy. It allows one to consider reality in terms of observed or measured reality, perceived or unmeasured reality, and actual reality \citep{bhaskar2013realist}. Unpacking these different realities using deductive, inductive and retroductive reasoning has been eye-opening and confidence-building for me. \medskip

I knew very little about social network analysis at the beginning of my doctoral studies. Because social network analysis is data-intensive, I decided to learn how to program in \texttt{R} to become more proficient at data manipulation. I completed online data science courses offered by John Hopkins University (USA), namely \enquote{Computing for Data Analysis}, \enquote{Getting and Cleaning Data}, \enquote{Exploratory Data Analysis}, and \enquote{The Data Scientist's Toolbox}. Each course took 4 weeks to complete. Having mastered basic \texttt{R} programming, I then did an 8-week online course entitled \enquote{Social Network Analysis} offered by the University of Michigan (USA). This course provided an excellent foundation in social network analysis. To cap things off, I attended a 5-day \enquote{Introduction to Social Network Analysis} course offered by the Swinburne University of Technology. This course introduced me to exponential random graph models. I now consider myself a reasonably competent social network analyst. \medskip

I did not appreciate how much thought has to go into designing an online survey questionnaire until I completed an online course entitled \enquote{Questionnaire Design for Social Surveys} offered by the University of Maryland (USA). This 4-week course taught me to formulate short and unambiguous questions, avoid responder fatigue, manage selective recall, and pilot surveys. One component of this course addressed interviewing skills, which prompted me to explore further the theory and practice of successful interview techniques \citep[e.g.][]{kvale2008doing,seidman2012interviewing}. I also attended a one-day CSIRO course entitled \enquote{Human Research Ethics for Researchers}. This course introduced me to the \enquote{The National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research}, which sets out national standards for the ethical design, review and conduct of human research. I made sure my research adhered to this standard. \medskip

I also completed a two-day introduction to \texttt{NVivo}\texttrademark\ course presented by QSR International as I planned to code semi-structured interview transcripts using this software package. Coding interview transcripts was particularly challenging for me. Everybody I spoke to approached coding differently. As \citet{saldana2015coding} notes, there is no right or wrong way to go about coding. After many false starts, I managed to find a way to code that allowed me to balance my thesis's quantitative and qualitative paradigms. Academic writing does not come easily to me. Early criticism of my writing was keenly felt. I only started to relax when it dawned upon me that I was becoming a \enquote{subject matter expert} and could communicate with some authority. \medskip

There is no doubt that I learned much about open innovation through my research. I discovered the importance of tacit knowledge for problem-solving and now understand how tacit knowledge defines who we are and what this means for power and trust relations. More importantly, I recognise the importance of skilled brokerage to facilitate tacit knowledge flows in open innovation.
