\chapter*{Abstract}

A growing number of companies are turning to open innovation to stay competitive. Open innovation is formally defined as \textquote{a distributed innovation process involving the purposive management of knowledge flows across organisational boundaries using pecuniary and non-pecuniary mechanisms in line with the firm's business model} \citep{chesbrough2014explicating}. The innovation process relies heavily on accessing, absorbing, and harnessing knowledge across organisational boundaries with open innovation. Tacit knowledge refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities an individual gains through experience that is difficult to put into words or otherwise communicate. It is strongly implicated in innovation as it guides the learning and thought processes that produce novel ideas. Despite the importance of tacit knowledge for innovation, it has received scant attention in the open innovation literature. \medskip

Open innovation implies extensive inter-organisational relationships to gain access to new external knowledge and exploit novel ideas. Proper understanding of open innovation processes requires a network rather than a firm-level perspective. This thesis treats an open innovation partnership as a temporary knowledge network deliberately set up to achieve a specific innovation outcome. It aims to improve our understanding of social mechanisms that enable or inhibit tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation by addressing four research questions: (1) What does the structure of tacit knowledge networks reveal about knowledge enacted in practice? (2) Does brokerage differ according to the type of knowledge exchanged? (3) To what extent does self-determination drive tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation? (4) What does the micro-structure of tacit knowledge networks reveal about trust and power relations in open innovation partnerships? Open innovation entails helping others develop the ability to apply knowing and knowledge in new and different contexts. Answers to these research questions should help people devise more effective strategies for bringing know-how and know-what together. \medskip

Sharing know-how is primarily an act of volition or free will. Hence, this thesis assumes human agency lies at the heart of tacit knowledge exchange. Finding the right balance between structure and agency is a challenge in open innovation. Too much structure may inhibit individual willingness to share tacit knowledge or contribute ideas. Conversely, too little structure can make goals less clear, leading to unsatisfactory open innovation outcomes. The academic literature suggests that human agents are primarily motivated to acquire tacit knowledge to satisfy an innate need for competence and gain sufficient power to maintain or enhance their autonomy, influence agendas, and enact change. External factors that affect tacit knowledge exchanges include subjective and behavioural norms, real or perceived boundaries, rules of engagement, and trust and power relations. The literature also suggests brokers have a crucial role in helping individuals overcome boundaries, build trust, and manage power relations. \medskip

This thesis used a combination of statistical social network analysis and semi-structured interviews to investigate the emergence of tacit knowledge network structures in three open innovation case studies. It used a critical realist approach to interpret quantitative and qualitative results. Most mixed-method studies embrace a pragmatic approach, where the goal is to obtain beneficial results, even though this involves alternating between paradigms. The stratified ontology of critical realism allows for the legitimate combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. A critical realist approach is particularly well-suited to a multiple case study approach where different contexts are in play. \medskip

The statistical social network analysis addressed observed or empirical reality. In contrast, the semi-structured interviews addressed unobserved or actual reality (the reality that shapes the emergence and functioning of knowledge provider networks). The statistical network analysis used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to infer social processes in each case study's tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. At the same time, the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews allowed a more profound exploration of the mechanisms and structures affecting tacit knowledge sharing. Applying the critical realist logic of retroduction and retrodiction to integrate the quantitative and qualitative results provided a more complete, expansive and diverse picture of the social mechanisms and structures affecting tacit knowledge sharing. \medskip

One set of ERGMs examined the role of motivation, trust, and power in tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Another set of ERGMs looked at broker roles in both the tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Results from the first set of ERGMs underscored the importance of tacit knowledge in open innovation. Path closure in a social network reflects a human tendency to form groups. Two of the partnerships had a significant path closure in their tacit knowledge networks. No such effect is evident in the explicit knowledge networks. In other words, tacit knowledge features strongly in group work. A significant receiver effect for autonomous motivation in each partnership's tacit knowledge network indicates that autonomous motivation is a reliable predictor of learning intent or knowledge-seeking behaviour. The second model runs indicate that path closure and broker roles can account for virtually all observed network configurations. Analysis of semi-structured interviews indicates that tacit knowledge is often under-valued, negatively impacting problem-solving and innovation. Moreover, the qualitative analysis indicates that brokers can profoundly affect the application of knowledge in practice. Tension was evident in those partnerships dominated by one individual. Trust features strongly in most decisions to share tacit knowledge. Perceived acts of self-interest erode trust and contribute to partner tension. Generally, people are less likely to disclose their hard-earned tacit knowledge in low-trust situations. \medskip

This thesis discovered that tacit knowledge resides in various internal and external communities of practice and that brokers are crucial for connecting these different communities. It confirmed that individuals are primarily motivated to seek out tacit knowledge to improve their level of self-determination. However, this thesis also found that close-minded individuals or individuals who consider themselves superior are less likely to connect with external communities of practice. The ability to tap external communities of practice is affected by several mechanisms, including actual or perceived boundaries and power and trust relations. This thesis also discovered that individuals are more likely to share their tacit knowledge if this delivers some personal benefit. It found that successful open innovation requires partners to invest in relationships to facilitate open and honest discussions vital for practical problem solving and innovation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}
\chapter*{Foreword}

One must demonstrate a capacity for independent, critical thinking in a doctoral thesis. Examiners want to see evidence of originality and logical arguments. They do not want to see careless mistakes that indicate sloppy research \citep{mullins2002its}. My goal in writing this thesis was to present a rigorous and coherent analysis of tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. It was clear early on that I would need a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to address my research questions. Reconciling different ontological and epistemological assumptions can be quite problematic in mixed-method research, which led me to embrace critical realism as my research philosophy. It allows one to consider reality in terms of observed or measured reality, perceived or unmeasured reality, and actual reality \citep{bhaskar2013realist}. Unpacking these different realities using deductive, inductive and retroductive reasoning has been eye-opening and confidence-building for me. \medskip

I knew very little about social network analysis at the beginning of my doctoral studies. Because social network analysis is data-intensive, I decided to learn how to program in \texttt{R} to become more proficient at data manipulation. I completed online data science courses offered by John Hopkins University (USA), namely \enquote{Computing for Data Analysis}, \enquote{Getting and Cleaning Data}, \enquote{Exploratory Data Analysis}, and \enquote{The Data Scientist's Toolbox}. Each course took 4 weeks to complete. Having mastered basic \texttt{R} programming, I then did an 8-week online course entitled \enquote{Social Network Analysis} offered by the University of Michigan (USA). This course provided an excellent foundation in social network analysis. To cap things off, I attended a 5-day \enquote{Introduction to Social Network Analysis} course offered by the Swinburne University of Technology. This course introduced me to exponential random graph models. I now consider myself a reasonably competent social network analyst. \medskip

I did not appreciate how much thought has to go into designing an online survey questionnaire until I completed an online course entitled \enquote{Questionnaire Design for Social Surveys} offered by the University of Maryland (USA). This 4-week course taught me to formulate short and unambiguous questions, avoid responder fatigue, manage selective recall, and pilot surveys. One component of this course addressed interviewing skills, which prompted me to explore further the theory and practice of successful interview techniques \citep[e.g.][]{kvale2008doing,seidman2012interviewing}. I also attended a one-day CSIRO course entitled \enquote{Human Research Ethics for Researchers}. This course introduced me to the \enquote{The National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research}, which sets out national standards for the ethical design, review and conduct of human research. I made sure my research adhered to this standard. \medskip

I also completed a two-day introduction to \texttt{NVivo}\texttrademark\ course presented by QSR International as I planned to code semi-structured interview transcripts using this software package. Coding interview transcripts was particularly challenging for me. Everybody I spoke to approached coding differently. As \citet{saldana2015coding} notes, there is no right or wrong way to go about coding. After many false starts, I managed to find a way to code that allowed me to balance my thesis's quantitative and qualitative paradigms. Academic writing does not come easily to me. Early criticism of my writing was keenly felt. I only started to relax when it dawned upon me that I was becoming a \enquote{subject matter expert} and could communicate with some authority. \medskip

There is no doubt that I learned much about open innovation through my research. I discovered the importance of tacit knowledge for problem-solving and now understand how tacit knowledge defines who we are and what this means for power and trust relations. More importantly, I recognise the importance of skilled brokerage to facilitate tacit knowledge flows in open innovation.
