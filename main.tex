\chapter*{Abstract}

A growing number of companies are turning to open innovation to stay competitive. With open innovation, the innovation process relies heavily on accessing, absorbing, and harnessing knowledge across organisational boundaries. Tacit knowledge refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities an individual gains through experience that is often difficult to put into words or otherwise communicate. It is strongly implicated in innovation as it guides the learning and thought processes that produce novel ideas. Despite the importance of tacit knowledge for innovation, it has received scant attention in the open innovation literature. This thesis explores the tacit dimension of open innovation. \medskip
\noindent
Open innovation implies extensive inter-organisational relationships to gain access to new external knowledge and exploit novel ideas. Proper understanding of open innovation processes requires a network rather than a firm-level perspective. This thesis treats an open innovation partnership as a temporary knowledge network deliberately set up to achieve a specific innovation outcome. It aims to improve our understanding of social mechanisms that enable or inhibit tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation by addressing four research questions: What does the structure of tacit knowledge networks reveal about knowledge enacted in practice? Does brokerage differ according to the type of knowledge exchanged? To what extent does self-determination drive tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation? What does the micro-structure of tacit knowledge networks reveal about trust and power relations in open innovation partnerships? \medskip
\noindent
As tacit knowledge sharing is primarily an act of volition or free will, this thesis assumes that human agency drives the emergence of tacit knowledge networks. Finding the right balance between structure and agency is a challenge in open innovation. Too much structure may inhibit individual willingness to share tacit knowledge or contribute ideas. Conversely, too little structure can make goals less clear, leading to unsatisfactory open innovation outcomes. The academic literature suggests that agents are primarily motivated to acquire tacit knowledge to satisfy an innate need for competence and gain sufficient power to maintain or enhance their autonomy, influence agendas, and enact change. External factors such as subjective and behavioural norms, real or perceived boundaries, rules of engagement, and trust and power relations are likely to influence tacit knowledge exchanges. The literature also indicates that brokers have a crucial role in helping individuals overcome boundaries, build trust, and manage power relations. \medskip
\noindent
This thesis used a combination of exponential random graph modelling (ERGMs) and semi-structured interviews to investigate how agency drives the emergence of tacit knowledge network structures in three open innovation case studies. Mixing quantitative and qualitative methods is challenging because of the complex ontological and epistemological issues involved. This thesis employed a critical realist methodology to interpret quantitative and qualitative results. The stratified ontology of critical realism allows for the legitimate combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. It is particularly well-suited to a multiple case study approach where different contexts are in play. ERGMs were used to infer social processes in tacit knowledge provider networks. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews allowed a more profound exploration of the mechanisms and structures affecting tacit knowledge sharing. Applying the logic of retroduction and retrodiction to integrate the quantitative and qualitative results provided a more complete, expansive and diverse picture of the social mechanisms and structures affecting tacit knowledge sharing. \medskip
\noindent
One set of ERGMs examined the role of motivation, trust, and power in tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Another set of ERGMs looked at broker roles in both the tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Results from the first set of ERGMs underscored the importance of tacit knowledge in open innovation. Path closure in a social network reflects a human tendency to form groups. Two of the partnerships had a significant path closure in their tacit knowledge networks. No such effect is evident in the explicit knowledge networks. In other words, tacit knowledge features strongly in group work. A significant receiver effect for autonomous motivation in each partnership's tacit knowledge network indicates that autonomous motivation is a reliable predictor of learning intent or knowledge-seeking behaviour. The second set of model runs indicates that path closure and broker roles can account for virtually all observed network configurations. Analysis of semi-structured interviews provided a deeper understanding of how agency and structure affect tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. Results indicate that tacit knowledge is often under-valued, which can impact negatively problem-solving and innovation. Brokers can have a profound effect on the application of knowledge in practice. Tension was evident in partnerships dominated by one individual, attributed to the fact that some partners are wary of a highly central actor dominating the discourse. Trust features strongly in most decisions to share tacit knowledge. Perceived acts of self-interest erode trust and contribute to partner tension. People are less likely to disclose their hard-earned tacit knowledge in low-trust situations. \medskip
\noindent
This thesis discovered that tacit knowledge resides in various internal and external communities of practice and that brokers are crucial for connecting different communities of practice. It confirmed that individuals are primarily motivated to seek out tacit knowledge to improve their level of self-determination. However, this thesis also found that individuals who are close-minded or consider themselves superior are less likely to connect with external communities of practice. The ability to tap external communities of practice is affected by several mechanisms that may include real or perceived boundaries and power and trust relations. This thesis also discovered that individuals are more likely to share their tacit knowledge if this delivers some benefit. It found that successful open innovation requires partners to invest in relationships to facilitate open and honest discussions so vital for effective problem solving and innovation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Foreword}
\chapter*{Foreword}

One must demonstrate a capacity for independent, critical thinking in a doctoral thesis. Examiners want to see evidence of originality and be presented with logical arguments. They do not want to see careless mistakes that indicate sloppy research \citep{mullins2002its}. My goal in writing this thesis was to present a rigorous and coherent analysis of tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. It was clear early on that I would need a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to address all of my research questions. I learnt that reconciling different ontological and epistemological assumptions can be quite problematic in mixed-method research. This led me to embrace critical realism as my research philosophy. It allows one to consider reality in terms of observed or  measured reality, perceived or unmeasured reality, and actual reality \citep{bhaskar2013realist}. Unpacking these different realities using deductive, inductive and retroductive reasoning has been eye-opening and confidence-building. \medskip

I knew very little about social network analysis at the beginning of my doctoral studies. Because social network analysis is data-intensive, I decided to learn how to program in \texttt{R} to become more proficient at data manipulation. I completed online data science courses offered by John Hopkins University (USA), namely \enquote{Computing for Data Analysis}, \enquote{Getting and Cleaning Data}, \enquote{Exploratory Data Analysis}, and \enquote{The Data Scientist's Toolbox}. Each course took 4 weeks to complete. Having mastered basic \texttt{R} programming, I then did an 8-week online course entitled \enquote{Social Network Analysis} offered by the University of Michigan (USA). This course provided an excellent foundation in social network analysis. To cap things off, I attended a 5-day \enquote{Introduction to Social Network Analysis} course offered by Swinburne University of Technology. This course introduced me to exponential random graph models. I now consider myself a competent social network analyst. \medskip

I did not appreciate how much thought has to go into designing an online survey questionnaire until I completed an online course entitled \enquote{Questionnaire Design for Social Surveys} offered by the University of Maryland (USA). This 4-week course taught me about formulating short and unambiguous questions, avoiding responder fatigue, managing selective recall, and piloting surveys. One component of the course addressed interviewing skills. This component prompted me to explore further the theory and practice of successful interview techniques \citep[e.g.][]{kvale2008doing,seidman2012interviewing}. Coding interview transcripts was particularly challenging for me. Everybody I spoke to approached coding differently. As \citet{saldana2015coding} notes, there is no right or wrong way to go about coding. After many false starts, I managed to find a way to code that worked for me. I still have much to learn about qualitative analysis but think I managed to balance my thesis's quantitative and qualitative paradigms. Academic writing does not come easily to me. Early criticism of my writing was keenly felt. I only started to relax when it dawned upon me that I was becoming a \enquote{subject matter expert} and could communicate with authority. \medskip

There is no doubt that I learned much about open innovation through my research. I discovered the importance of tacit knowledge for problem-solving and now understand how tacit knowledge defines who we are, and what this means in terms of power and trust relations. More importantly, I recognise the importance of skilled brokerage to facilitate tacit knowledge flows in open innovation.
