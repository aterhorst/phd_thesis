\chapter*{Abstract}

Tacit knowledge refers to an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities through experience that is difficult to put into words or otherwise communicate. It is strongly implicated in innovation as it guides the learning and thought processes that produce novel ideas. This thesis explores tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. Because open innovation relies on extensive inter-organisational relationships to access new external knowledge and exploit novel ideas, a network perspective is needed to understand open innovation processes fully. This thesis treats an open innovation partnership as a temporary knowledge network to achieve a specific innovation outcome. The actions of individual participants from each partner organisation ultimately determine the functional structure of an open innovation partnership. This thesis argues that human agency lies at the heart of tacit knowledge exchange. Finding the right balance between structure and agency is a challenge in open innovation. Too much structure may inhibit individual willingness to share tacit knowledge or contribute ideas. Conversely, too little structure can make goals less clear, leading to unsatisfactory open innovation outcomes. Human agents are primarily motivated to acquire tacit knowledge to satisfy an innate need for competence and gain sufficient power to maintain or enhance their autonomy, influence agendas, and enact change. External factors that affect tacit knowledge exchanges include subjective and behavioural norms, real or perceived boundaries, rules of engagement, and trust and power relations. Knowledge brokers have a crucial role in helping individuals overcome boundaries, build trust, and manage power relations. \medskip

This thesis uses a combination of statistical models for social networks (exponential random graph models - ERGMs) and semi-structured interviews to investigate the emergence of tacit knowledge network structures in three open innovation case studies. The modelling addressed the role of motivation, trust, power and brokerage in tacit and explicit knowledge provider networks. Modelling results show that tacit knowledge sharing features strongly in group work. The modelling also indicates that autonomous motivation is a reliable predictor of learning intent or knowledge-seeking behaviour and that tacit knowledge sharing and trust ties are strongly aligned. One can account for virtually all observed network configurations by simply modelling broker roles, highlighting the significance of brokerage in open innovation. The broker roles provide valuable insight into knowledge exchange mechanisms and what this potentially means for absorptive and desorptive capacity in open innovation. Analysis of semi-structured interviews indicates that tacit knowledge is often under-appreciated, negatively impacting problem-solving and innovation. The ability to tap into external communities of practice is affected by several mechanisms, including actual or perceived boundaries and power and trust relations. Tension was evident in those partnerships dominated by one individual. Perceived acts of self-interest erode trust and contribute to partner tension. Generally, people are less likely to disclose their hard-earned tacit knowledge in low-trust situations. This thesis also reveals that individuals are more likely to share their tacit knowledge if it delivers personal benefit.

\chapter*{Dedication}

This study is dedicated to my late parents. Without their support, I would never have been able to go to university and pursue an interesting career in research and development. I am sad they are not around to see me graduate as a Doctor of Philosophy. They would have been proud, I am sure.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) funded this study in partnership with the Australian Research Council's Pathways to Market Industrial Transformation Hub hosted by the University of Tasmania. \medskip

The author wishes to acknowledge the CSIRO for their extraordinary support and encouragement to get the job done. He is grateful to his supervisors, Professor Dean Lusher, Associate Professor Dianne Bolton, Dr Ian Elsum and Dr Peng Wang, for their patience, guidance and help. Associate Professor Dianne Bolton deserves special mention for her never-ending encouragement and support. Dr Peng Wang extended \texttt{MPNet} to include the \citet{gould1989structures} broker role parameters. Without these additional parameters, the author would not have been able to model broker roles in his case studies. \medskip

Dr Aysha Fleming from the CSIRO provided helpful comments on chapter drafts. Ms Karin Hosking checked the formatting, style, and accuracy of the text in this manuscript. Professor Garry Robins and Dr Johan Koskinen (University of Melbourne) and Professor Carter Butts (University of California, Irvine) provided advice on exponential random graph modelling. Professor Ronald Burt (University of Chicago Booth School of Business), Professor Henry Chesbrough (Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley), and Associate Professor David Obstfeld (California State University) shared pre-publication material with the author. The author also wants to thank fellow doctoral candidates, Dr Bopha Roden and Dr Sarah King, for their friendship and support. \medskip

Last but not least, the author thanks the Swinburne University of Technology Higher Degree Research Office, particularly Ms Anne Caine and Mr Dino Moll-S\'anchez, for helping him navigate the rules and procedures of doctoral studies.

\chapter*{Foreword}

One must demonstrate a capacity for independent, critical thinking in a doctoral thesis. Examiners want to see evidence of originality and logical arguments. They do not want to see careless mistakes that indicate sloppy research \citep{mullins2002its}. My goal in writing this thesis was to present a rigorous and coherent analysis of tacit knowledge sharing in open innovation. It was clear early on that I would need a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis to address my research question. Reconciling different ontological and epistemological assumptions can be problematic in mixed-method research, which led me to embrace critical realism as my research philosophy. \medskip

The first year of my candidature involved much coursework. I knew little about social network analysis at the beginning of my candidature. Because social network analysis is data-intensive, I decided to learn how to program in \texttt{R}. To this end, I completed online data science courses offered by John Hopkins University (USA), namely \enquote{Computing for Data Analysis}, \enquote{Getting and Cleaning Data}, \enquote{Exploratory Data Analysis}, and \enquote{The Data Scientist's Toolbox}. Each course took four weeks to complete. Having mastered basic \texttt{R} programming, I then did an 8-week online course entitled \enquote{Social Network Analysis} offered by the University of Michigan (USA). This course provided an excellent foundation in social network analysis. To cap things off, I attended a 5-day \enquote{Introduction to Social Network Analysis} course offered by the Swinburne University of Technology, which introduced me to exponential random graph models. \medskip

Much thought has to go into designing an online survey questionnaire, which led to me doing an online course entitled \enquote{Questionnaire Design for Social Surveys} offered by the University of Maryland (USA). This 4-week course taught me to formulate short and unambiguous questions, avoid responder fatigue, manage selective recall, and pilot surveys. One component of this course addressed interviewing skills, which prompted me to explore further the theory and practice of successful interview techniques. To understand the \enquote{The National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research}, I attended a one-day CSIRO course entitled \enquote{Human Research Ethics for Researchers}. This course addressed the ethical design, review and conduct of human research. I also completed a two-day introduction to \texttt{NVivo}\texttrademark\ course presented by QSR International as I planned to code semi-structured interview transcripts using this software.  \medskip

Coding interview transcripts was particularly challenging for me. Everybody I spoke to approached coding differently. As \citet{saldana2015coding} notes, there is no right or wrong way to go about coding. After many false starts, I managed to find a way to code that allowed me to balance my thesis's quantitative and qualitative paradigms. Academic writing also does not come easily to me. I keenly felt early criticism of my writing. I only started to relax when it dawned upon me that I was becoming a \enquote{subject matter expert} and could communicate with some authority. There is no doubt that I learned much about open innovation through my research. I discovered the importance of tacit knowledge for problem-solving and now understand how tacit knowledge defines who we are and what this means for power and trust relations. More importantly, I recognise the importance of skilled brokerage to facilitate tacit knowledge flows in open innovation.
